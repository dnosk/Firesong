  <h1>Firesong<div class="subheader">Privacy Policy</div></h1>
  <p>
    Firesong is committed to respecting the privacy of your data. Firesong stores the absolute minimum amount of data for the purpose of interacting with the Slack API.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What we collect
  </h3>
  <p>
    Some data is stored by Firesong, so that interaction with the Slack API is possible. This includes the access token, the team name, the team id, the user id and the tasks that you save from Slack using Firesong. Apart from that, we only save the Slack profile information of the users who sent a DM to Firesong. This is the information that you provided in Slack such as your email address, username and timezone.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The fact that you sent or received a message while talking with Firesong in DM is logged, for statistical purpose, to improve our operations, as well as to help debugging potential technical issues.
  </p>
  <h3>

    Firesong does not store any password. Access to your Slack account is only done through Slack API.
